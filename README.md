# sql-challenge
I have created the ERD using QuickDBD
I have created the tables using pgAdmin
I began to query the data and then realised I had not successfully imported the data
I was unable to acheive the data import successfully despite analysing many error messages. The main issue was foreign keys and also having non-unique data in the emp_no column for the dept_emp table. I tried to alter the table to create a unique id column but have now run out of time as I need to move onto the next challenge.
